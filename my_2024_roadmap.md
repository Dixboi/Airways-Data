# Self-Taught Data Engineering 2024 Roadmap
Hello. Since I'm still new in the data engineering field, I wanted to have a roadmap for 2024 so that I won't get lost during my learning process. The contents here are highly personal and subject to change (depending on the knowledge that I will gain).

## January - March
Focus more on work to soak up all of the experience and to review for the Civil Service Exam (Jan-Feb).

## April - June
Learn more about Data Engineering Fundamentals and have a strong foundation about it. Terminologies, processes, important things to consider.
Possible materials to consider:
1. [Kahan Data Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy4OcwImJzBKg3rmROyI_CBBAYlQISkOO) - FREE

## July - August
Learn more about Data Engineering and take all the activities in Google Cloud Skills Boost from [Database Engineer Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/22)

## September - November
TBD - depending on what I will gather from studying the fundamentals
