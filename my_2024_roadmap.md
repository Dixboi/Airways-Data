# Self-Taught Data Engineering 2024 Roadmap
Hello. Since I'm still new in the data engineering field, I wanted to have a roadmap for 2024 so that I won't get lost during my learning process. The contents here are highly personal and subject to change (depending on the knowledge that I will gain).

## January - March
Learn more about Data Engineering and take all the activities in Google Cloud Skills Boost from [Database Engineer Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/22)

## April
Setup a local database using MySQL for a simple finance dataset. The finance dataset is from [Kaggle Finance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/creepycrap/finance-dataset)

## May
Use Airflow for scheduling and making DAGs that will be stored in a local MySQL database. The data will come from [Currency API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api)

## June
Model a small e-commerce database with dimension tables using MySQL Workbench. Here is a guide to make an [e-commerce data model](https://fabric.inc/blog/commerce/ecommerce-data-model)

## July
Utilize dbt for data cleaning and transformation. Apply it on [Kaggle e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

## August
Make use of SQL for data management or database design in MySQL. Apply it on the same [Kaggle e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
