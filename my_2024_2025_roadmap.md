# Self-Taught Data Engineering 2024 Roadmap
Hello. Since I'm still new in the data engineering field, I wanted to have a roadmap for 2024 so that I won't get lost during my learning process. The contents here are highly personal and subject to change (depending on the knowledge that I will gain).

## January - March 2024
Focus more on work to soak up all of the experience and to review for the Civil Service Exam (Jan-Feb).

## April - November 2024
Learn more about Data Engineering Fundamentals and have a strong foundation about it. Terminologies, processes, important things to consider, principles, and practices.
