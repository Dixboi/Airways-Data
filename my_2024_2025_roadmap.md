# Self-Taught Data Engineering 2024 Roadmap
Hello. Since I'm still new in the data engineering field, I wanted to have a roadmap for 2024 and 2025 so that I won't get lost during my learning process. The contents here are highly personal and subject to change (depending on the knowledge that I will gain). My goal is to have a stronger foundation on concepts and terminologies on 2024 and then to create multiple projects during 2025.

## January - March 2024
Focus more on work to soak up all of the experience and to review for the Civil Service Exam (Jan-Feb).

## April - December 2024
Widen professional network and online presence through the following:
- Writing a blog once a month on Medium about AI and Data Ethics
- Writing a blog once a month on Hashnode about my personal tech journey
- Mentoring at least one person in Exercism per month
- Contribute on topics on LinkedIn

Improve communication skills:
- English speaking
- listening
- email writing

## January - October 2025
Learn more about Data Engineering Fundamentals and have a strong foundation about it. Terminologies, processes, important things to consider, principles, and practices.
